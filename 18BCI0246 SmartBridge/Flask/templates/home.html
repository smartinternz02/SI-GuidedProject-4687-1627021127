          Over 2 Million visa petitions are filed by the employers each year and only 65000 petitions are approved. So, the goal is to explore the petitions filed and their outcomes for the past six years i.e., from 2011 to 2016, and to find a pattern to predict the outcome by using a predictive model developed using Machine Learning techniques.



<br><br>IThe goal of the project is to predict the outcome of H-1B visa applications that are filed by many professional foreign nationals every year. Here, we framed the problem as a classification problem and applied it in order to output a predicted case status of the application. The input to our algorithm is the attributes of the applicant. H-1B is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States that allows foreign nationals to work in occupations that require specialized knowledge and a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher in the specific specialty. This visa requires the applicant to have a job offer from an employer in the US before they can file an application to the US immigration service (USCIS). We believe that this prediction algorithm could be a useful resource both for the future H-1B visa applicants and the employers who are considering sponsoring them.

<br><br>In order to predict the case status of the applicants, we will be feeding the model with the dataset which contains the required fields by which the machine can classify the case status as certified or denied.
